#  Gym Membership Data Visualization Project

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing a gym membership dataset using Python. It highlights patterns in customer behavior and membership trends through various types of plots.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create clear, informative visualizations that help understand:
- Member demographics
- Membership types
- Age distribution
- Gender ratio
- Activity levels

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset `gym_members.csv` contains details about:
- Member ID  
- Name, Gender, Age  
- Membership type  
- Join date  
- Activity level (Low, Medium, High)

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Created

- **Bar Plots** â€“ Gender distribution, membership counts  
- **Pie Chart** â€“ Activity level proportion  
- **Histogram** â€“ Age distribution  
- **Boxplot** â€“ Age vs. membership type  
- **Count Plot** â€“ Activity level by gender
